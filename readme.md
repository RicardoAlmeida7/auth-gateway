# Zero Trust Auth Gateway

A secure authentication gateway built with Java and Spring Boot, following Clean Architecture principles.  
This project is part of a portfolio focused on security-first design using modern best practices.

## üìã API Endpoints Overview

### Authentication (`/api/v1/auth`)

- `POST /token` - Login with rate limiting  
- `DELETE /token` - Logout  
- `POST /token/refresh` - JWT token refresh  
- `GET /status/{userId}` - User login status with rate limiting  

### User Management (public and profile) (`/api/v1/users`)

- `POST /` - Public user registration (rate limited)  
- `POST /activation` - Account activation via token (rate limited)  
- `POST /activation/resend` - Resend activation email (rate limited)  
- `PUT /me` - Update authenticated user profile  

### Admin User Management (`/api/v1/admin/users`)

- `POST /` - Create new user (admin)  
- `GET /` - List users with pagination (admin)  
- `GET /{userId}` - User details (admin)  
- `PUT /{userId}` - Update user (admin)  
- `PUT /{userId}/block` - Block user (admin)  
- `DELETE /{userId}/block` - Unblock user (admin)  
- `DELETE /{userId}` - Delete user (admin)  

### Password Reset (`/api/v1/users/password-reset`)

# üìÇ Postman Collection
A Postman collection has been created to simplify API testing, including all public endpoints with examples and environment variables.

---

## ‚úÖ Features
- Clean Architecture (domain, application, infrastructure separation)
- Spring Security configured with endpoint access control
- In-memory H2 database for development
- H2 Web Console enabled for testing
- Profile-based environment configuration (`dev`, `prod`)
- Unit tests with high code coverage using JaCoCo

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Run in development mode (H2 memory DB)

```bash
./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev'
```

---

## üß™ Run All Unit Tests with Coverage Report

```bash
./gradlew clean test jacocoTestReport
```

After running, open the report at:

```bash
build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html
```
---

# üê≥ Run with Docker (Postgres + Redis)
For local development, you can run Postgres and Redis using Docker.

Start containers with Docker Compose
## Start services in background
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start:

* `Postgres on localhost:5432`
* `Redis on localhost:6379`

### Stop and remove containers
```
docker-compose down
```
To also remove volumes (clear data):
```
docker compose down -v
```

---

## üîí To Do

* Implement asynchronous email sending using Kafka or RabbitMQ to decouple email notifications

* Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

* Write integration tests with Cucumber

* Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints

* Containerize application with Docker and define Docker Compose setup for local development

* Implement Flyway migrations fully for production environment

* Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated build, test, and deploy
